### **Two sentences explaining your top findings:**

We found that air quality was in general getting better in the U.S and that around ~2007, it started to get better drastically, which could likely be tied to the recession that was happening at the time in the U.S. Geographically speaking, we found that California (not surprisingly) had the worse air quality of all of the states, with the states in the Midwest also having pretty poor air quality, whereas the northern states seem to have the best air quality in the U.S. For further analysis on these findings, see our project page.

### **Two sentences explaining what you found most challenging in making your project:**
One of the most challenging things was to be able to make reasonable plots and conclusions with the data that we had and not try to overreach in any of our conclusions, we wanted the plots to reflect simply what was in the data. Another thing that was very challenging was trying to format all of the plots and widgets together into one interface/page that was clean and easy to use.
