With the use of this data, our project will include maps, graphs, and bar plots that will change depending on different user inputs including, states, counties, PM measurements, and year. One of our graphs is a line plot that shows the change in county air quality over time with the ability to change the input of states and air quality metrics.  This will give the user the ability to see different measurements in varying states and counties over time.  Another one of our graphs will be a map that shows the concentration of poor air quality in different states and counties. This will give the user a very good visual to compare different parts of the U.S. to others.  Our last graph is a bar plot that shows air quality metrics by state.  By inputing a state and air quality metic, there will by an output of state by air quality, by year."),

With the expectation that air quality and other environmental features decrease in standard, it is important to track these data points to better understand our downfalls so that we will be able to efficiently combat environmental problems.  If it has gotten better over time it is also important to understand how we improved the air quality and how we can continue in that path toward cleaner air.  Through working with this data, our group wants to find states with the worst air quality vs. the best air quality, with this knowledge we get a better understanding of how we can improve air quality as a country and translate that into impacting our environment less and less over time."),
